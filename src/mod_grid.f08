! =============================================================================
!> Module containing all grid-related things.
!! Contains subroutines to create the base grid, Gaussian grid and
!! scale factors. Also handles mesh accumulation.
!! An integral of \(f(x)\) in \([a, b]\) can be approximated with
!! $$ f(x) \approx 0.5(b-a)\sum_{i=1}^n\bigl[w_i f\bigl(0.5(b-a)x_i + 0.5(a+b)\bigr)\bigr] $$
!! where \(w_i\) and \(x_i\) are the weights and nodes of the Gaussian quadrature.
!! The Gaussian grid is hence set up in every interval \([a, b]\) across the
!! four nodes \(j\) as
!! $$ x_i(j) = 0.5 * dx * w_i(j) + 0.5(a + b) $$

  !> General grid initialisations.
  !! Initialises both the regular grid and the Gaussian grid.
  !! Does calls to the mesh accumulation routines if needed,
  !! and sets the scale factor and its derivative.
  !! @note  In order to avoid spurious eigenvalues in cylindrical geometry,
  !!        the default start is set at <tt> r = 0.025 </tt> instead of
  !!        <tt> r = 0 </tt>. The latter can be explicitly enforced by
  !!        setting <tt>force_r0</tt> to <tt>True</tt> in the parfile. @endnote
  !! @warning   Explicitly forcing zero on-axis can give rise to spurious eigenvalues and
  !!            all kinds of other issues (huge values, division by zero, etc). @endwarning
  !! @warning   Throws an error if the geometry is not set. @endwarning
  !! @warning   Throws a warning if <tt>r = 0</tt> is forced in cylindrical geometry.
