    excerpt:
      Legolas, short for **L**arge **E**igensystem **G**enerator for **O**ne-dimensional p**LAS**mas, is a novel
      finite element code tailored to (M)HD spectroscopy of 3D Cartesian/cylindrical equilibria with nontrivial 1D variation.
      The code includes a myriad of physical effects, most of which are fully user-customisable.

    excerpt:
      Legolas is written in object-oriented Fortran (2008 standard) with a complementary Python framework (Pylbo)
      used for post-processing, data analysis, interfacing and parallel running. Both source codes are extensively
      documented and we provide a detailed guide on how to get started with the code.

what_legolas_can_do:
  - image_path: /assets/images/example_suydam.png
    excerpt:
      Legolas can do a multitude of things, ranging from full spectrum calculations to eigenfunctions
      of specific modes, to full-on parametric studies of various equilibrium configurations in different geometries.
      You can take a look at all the various [equilibria](/general/equilibria/) that are already implemented, or read
      more on our About section.

  - image_path: /assets/images/history.png
    excerpt:
      Legolas is the result of months and months of development and testing. Since this takes a lot of effort and time,
      we kindly ask that _**the first published peer-reviewed paper from applying Legolas is done in co-authorship with at least
      one of the original authors**_. Additionally, if you use Legolas in a publication we kindly request that you cite the code paper.
